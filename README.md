"# Master's Thesis Poject" 
# Developing methods and tools to enrich regions of gene of interest on the UMAP for single and multipe genes for a single cell RNA-seq data. Linking the enrichment to pathway information for interpretation of 
# genes in cell and sub-cell types in the data-set.
# Tools can be a good modification or integration to the Seurat pipeline used for analysis of Single-cell Data.
