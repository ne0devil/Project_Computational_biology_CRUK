"# Master's Thesis Poject" 
# Developing methods and tools to enrich regions of gene of interest on the UMAP for single and multipe genes for a single cell RNA-seq data. Linking the enrichment to pathway information which will in turn help us biologically interpret the genes and cell types in the Single Cell data-set.
# Tools can be a good modification or integration to the Seurat pipeline used for analysis of Single-cell Data.
